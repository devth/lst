# lst

lst is a simple list-building tool with an email interface. It's built on Clojure with
Noir, sends and receives email with Mailgun, and runs on Heroku.

## Usage

Email items to a@lst.herokuapp.com (the subject is also considered an "item"). It
will create your new list or append to your existing list and send the full contents
to sender.
